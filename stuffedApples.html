<ul>
	<p> Ingredients</p>
	<li>8 apples</li>
	<li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
	<li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
	
	<p> Crumble Topping </p>
	<li>1/2 cup flour</li>
	<li>1/4 cup oats</li>
	<li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
	<li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
	<li>4 tablespoons butter - chilled and cut into cubes</li>

	<p>Instructions</p>
	<li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees farenheit. First, prepare the crumble topping. In a medium bowl whisk together flour, oats, brown sugar, sugar, salt, and cinnamon. Cut in the butter with a pastry knife, or two forks, or with your hands until mixture is crumbly. Set aside.</li>
	<li>Peel and chop 4 of the apples. Add chopped apples, butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon to a medium sauce pan and saute over medium heat for 8-10 minutes or until apples are tender. Remove from heat.</li>
	<li>Chop the tops off of the remaining 4 apples and use a spoon to scoop out the flesh. Discard the flesh or save it for another recipe.You do not need to get every little bit out, just enough to make a bowl for the filling.</li>
	<li>Fill scooped-out apples with apple filling from the sauce pan. Top with a generous amount of crumble topping.</li>
	<li>Place stuffed apples on a baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes until crumble topping is crispy. Serve warm and top with ice cream and caramel sauce if desired. Enjoy!</li>
